I explored and experimented with different model architectures. 
After exploration decided with base-model as ResNet50 with additional 1 Dense layer. 
Initially the validation accuracy was coming around 0.94. Post adding L2-regularization on the final output layer, achieved a accuracy of 0.98 for train and val.
